# [](#header-1)Purpose
Hi to everyone, the purpose of this blog is to share you some write-ups: CTF challenges' write-ups, TryHackMe machines' write-ups and HackTheBox machines' write-ups!

This blog's posts will also be dedicated to various cybersecurity topics. :)

If my capabilities allows me to reach a certain level, I will try to write some technical articles about blue team and red team topics!


I will also share my journeys about cybersecurity certifications.
